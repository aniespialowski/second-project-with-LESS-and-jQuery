# second-project-with-LESS-and-jQuery

Project "Company".
It is my second website project - more difficult than first one. 
Project was created in HTML5, CSS3, Leaner Style Sheets (LESS), and jQuery plugins (bxsilder, owl-carousel, imagesloaded, countTo, YTPlayer).
The project presents the start page of a "fictional" company.
Responsive Web Design project.
The project was inspired by a workshop that I did as part of the CSS course from the "strefa.kurs√≥w.pl" platform.
